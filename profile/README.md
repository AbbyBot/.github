Welcome to the **AbbyBot Project**! Our goal is to develop a multifunctional tool for **administration** and **entertainment** purposes, built as a Discord bot. AbbyBot is designed to enhance user interaction and server management, offering a variety of features to cater to different needs.

## System Overview <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70af67a7-387e-4ffd-bc7d-b16ccbbbfb56" width="60" height="60">

The AbbyBot system consists of several interconnected services, each playing a crucial role in delivering a complete experience:

1. **AbbyBot (Discord Bot):** The core of the project, AbbyBot, manages Discord servers with administrative features, event handling, and storytelling functions.
2. **Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface where server administrators can configure and monitor bot activities, available to those who add AbbyBot to their server.
3. **API:** Provides integration services to manage bot data and synchronize server information.
4. **Website:** A promotional website where users can learn more about AbbyBot and add it to their wishlists. Check it out at the end of this document!
